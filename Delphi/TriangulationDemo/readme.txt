This demo is intended to showcase Clipper's triangulation.

The widely used OpenGL graphics library is a perfect example of why triangulation may be useful. The only way OpenGL can rasterize polygons (including text) is when they've been triangulated. This demo uses both OpenGL and Clipper to display complex polygons. (Requires OpenGL vers 3.0 or higher.)
